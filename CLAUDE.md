# Agency Dashboard — project context

Read this first. It's the working context for the project so a fresh session
doesn't have to re-derive decisions that were already made.

## Who this is for

Zach Hayes, a Farm Bureau Insurance agent in Michigan, in the New Agent
Development Program (NADP 6.0). He is not a programmer — explain things in
plain language, don't assume familiarity with code, and prefer doing the work
over handing back instructions.

## What it is

A single-page dashboard for tracking his book of business, deployed to GitHub
Pages. No backend, no database. Everything lives in the browser's local
storage on whatever machine he opens it on.

- Repo: `zacharyjhayes5-beep/my-codee` (note the double *e* — the local git
  remote may still say `my-code`, which redirects)
- Live: https://zacharyjhayes5-beep.github.io/my-codee/
- Deploy: pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- App lives in `dashboard/`; `vite.config.ts` sets `base: '/my-codee/'` —
  this matches the repo name and must not be "fixed"

## Commands

```sh
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # tsc -b && vite build — run before every commit
npm run lint     # oxlint
```

## Tabs

| Tab | File | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operator | `OperatorTab.tsx` | Console-style home: vitals, progress orb, command deck, big goal |
| Progress | `ProgressTab.tsx` | Book of business, earnings, goals, pace, NADP tiers |
| To-Do | `TodoTab.tsx` | Tasks in four urgency buckets, with Obsidian/Gmail import |
| Prospects | `ProspectsTab.tsx` | Profiles built from Granola call notes |
| Lead Map | `LeadMap.tsx` | Force-directed graph of prospects, lines and areas |

## Decisions already made — don't relitigate these

**Goals.** Property 40 policies, Casualty 40, Life 25. Period runs
2026-01-01 → 2027-01-01. He gave the end date; the start is an assumption he
has been told about and can edit on the Progress tab.

**Book of business formulas.** Ported from his own spreadsheet and must stay
exactly this:

```
Gross Commission = Premium × Percentage Earned
Net Commission   = Gross + (Gross × Multiplier)
```

Three books mirror his workbook's sheets: Personal, Life (adds death benefit
and a running count), Commercial (company name and notes). A month filter
stands in for the twelve monthly sheets.

**One source of truth.** Policy counts and premium are *derived* from the
book of business, never typed twice. `PolicyLine` holds only the goals.
Line of business is a catalog in `lib/policies.ts`, each option mapped to a
property/casualty/life category, which is what drives the meters and gauges.

**NADP tiers.** From the commission multiplier table (Part V, month-6 row) of
the 2026 Agency Compensation guide. He chose ascending — Tier 3 is the top:

| Tier | Multiplier | Property + Casualty | Life |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | 0.50× | 50 | 12 |
| Tier 2 | 0.70× | 63 | 18 |
| Tier 3 | 1.00× | 77 | 24 |

Property and Casualty are counted **together** because the guide's P/C table
is one combined policy count. Targets live in `monthSixTiers` in
`lib/defaultData.ts`; other month rows from the same table drop in there.

**All-American.** 2026 qualifications for agents contracted 2022 or after,
shown on the Progress tab below the tiers. Two alternative paths — $11,000 new
life commission + 35 life policies, or $9,000 + 50 — and both additionally need
85% 36-month life persistency and 1 new annuity, so those two are rendered once
above the path cards rather than repeated in each.

He confirmed the commission threshold is measured on **gross** commission, not
net — the multiplier bonus does not count toward it. Annuities are excluded
from the All-American life policy count because the guide lists them as their
own requirement; `annuity: true` in `lib/policies.ts` marks them, and
`lifeBreakdown()` does the split. This is deliberately *not* how the goal
meters and tier gauges count life, which keep annuities in.

**Theme.** Single dark theme, neon blue (`--accent`) and neon red
(`--neon-red`). No light mode. Console styling on the Operator tab: monospace
labels, bracketed panel corners, uppercase headers. Pulsing animation is
rationed to things worth looking at and must stay behind
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

**No new dependencies** unless there's a real reason. The force-directed
graph, the gas tanks and the progress orb are all hand-rolled SVG.

## Local storage keys

`fb-dashboard:` prefixed — `lines:v3`, `policies`, `tasks`, `suggestions`,
`dismissed`, `prospects`, `period`, `owner`, `persistency`. `lib/migrate.ts`
carries old shapes forward; add a migration rather than orphaning his data.

**Storage is per origin, and this has already confused him once.** The live
site and a local dev server are two unconnected sets of data — work entered on
one is invisible on the other, and looks to him like the dashboard "lost" it.
Before treating missing data as a bug, ask which address he entered it on.
`components/BackupPanel.tsx` is the bridge: it exports every `fb-dashboard:`
key to a JSON file and restores it anywhere. It reads the prefix rather than a
fixed list, so a new key is included automatically — but a key that does *not*
carry the prefix will be silently left out of backups.

## How to verify work

There are no unit tests. Verify by driving the real app in a browser and
checking computed figures against hand calculation — that's how every feature
so far was checked. Playwright with the system Chromium works. Don't report
something as working without having actually run it.

## Open questions

1. **Tier reference.** He said the tier tables were out of date and sent a
   replacement, but the PDF was byte-identical to the previous one and the
   photo was the All-American qualifications page, not a tier table. Still
   waiting on a straight-on photo of the pages with the new numbers.
2. **Premium goals.** Per-line premium goals are unset (0), so those meters
   read "no goal set" until he enters targets.
3. **Backup is manual.** Back up / Restore now exist in the header, but he has
   to remember to press the button. Nothing warns him when the last backup is
   old, and nothing carries data between the live site and a local copy on its
   own.
4. **Persistency is typed in.** All-American needs a 36-month life persistency
   figure the book of business cannot produce. It is a manual field on the
   Progress tab (`fb-dashboard:persistency`), so it is only as current as the
   last time he read it off a Farm Bureau report.
5. **"Inforce and retained" is approximated.** The All-American policy count is
   every life policy written in the period. Nothing tracks lapses, so a policy
   that lapses still counts — the real figure could be lower.

## Things he's asked about

Obsidian, second brain, mind maps, the "agentic OS" dashboards circulating on
social media. He has a plain Obsidian vault and no plugins. The To-Do tab
already parses dropped Obsidian notes and Gmail `.eml` files into
suggestions. A local session can read the vault directly — that was the main
reason for moving to the desktop app.
